The main functionality of AI Morph Lab Applications is a provision to you entertainment services, specifically, services of replacement of faces on photos or videos with your face. For this purpose, we need to process your face image in order to derive and create your individual digital face profile based on dots.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"><span>b. The only scenario when we use your face profile is when you request us to create a new photo or video with replaced faces. In this scenario we will recognise a photo you provide as a reference, create your individual digital face profile and further apply your individual digital face profile to a photo or a video you provided us or suggested by us for replacement of faces. Once the generation of a new photo or a</span> <span>video with replaced faces is done, we will automatically delete your individual digital face profile.</span></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"><span>c. From a technical perspective, the analysis and further creation of an individual digital face are performed on third-party servers and not on your device. The factual recognition and generation of new photos or videos are performed by artificial intelligence applications and software owned and operated by us.</span></p>

            <p> </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"><span>e.</span><strong><span> We do not </span>and will never use your <span>individual digital face profile </span>in a way which allows or confirms the unique identification of you and/or </strong><span><strong>for the purpose of your</strong> identification or authentication, controlling your access or use of AI Morph Lab Applications or our services, making any kind of decision about you, including automated decision making.</span> </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;" align="justify"><span>f. According to the law of certain jurisdictions, your individual digital face profile</span> may be considered as biometric data, however, once we do not use this biometrical data for uniquely identifying you as a natural person, it shall not be considered a special category of a personal data and thus such processing shall not be considered processing of special category of data.</p>
